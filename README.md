# gear-calulators
This repo allows users to generate gear tooth profiles using Jupyter Notebook's powerful scientific Python libraries. You can generate the plots, and use them in 3d modeling software to build geometrically correct gears for animation and 3d printing.

The process of modeling the gear in Blender is pretty complicated (at least the techneque I use), I plan to add additional instructions on how to do this in the future. There may be other solutions available. 

As of 11/27/2022, only gear calculations with module = 1 are supported. I will be adding additional features to improve the capabilities of this algorithm.
